# minesweeper-comp
Low-stakes private minesweeper competition held between 10/20 and 10/29 2020.

## Why?
This competition was intended as a short reintroduction to Python coding for several high school sophomores after completing a basic introductory course in freshman year. This course was not the sole Python experience of most contestants, however, which can be reflected in their code.

## Rules?
This was an extremely informal competition with no real rules or guidelines: a combination of a good final project and clean, good code would net a win.

## Notes
@c_tharas, or Charlie Tharas, or *me* acted as the judge for the competition, additionally writing my own Minesweeper because I thought it could be fun. An early-development, source code, and full build of that project is in the /c_tharas_dev directory.

## Winner
j_wu won with his code [here](https://repl.it/@abstractlegwear/minesweeper#main.py)
